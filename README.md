1. Reading and Analyzing Data:
You can use pandas to read data from CSV, Excel, or even SQL databases.
2. Generating the Report:
You can export the analyzed data back into a new CSV or Excel file using pandas.
3. Sending Email with Attachment:
Use Pythonâ€™s smtplib to send emails.
4.Error Logging:
If an error occurs, it's logged to a file named automation_errors.log using the logging module.
5.CSV Generation:
The original pandas code to generate a CSV report is still there. The read_and_analyze_data function reads the data, performs the analysis, and saves the report.
6.PDF Generation:
The generate_pdf_report function takes the same report_data and generates a PDF report using ReportLab. It saves the PDF file as sales_report.pdf.
7.Email Sending:
The send_email_with_attachment function sends the email with attachments. It is called twice: once for the CSV report and once for the PDF report.
